A weather app using aws s3 bucket
This weather app fethces weather data once you input a tag inside the awsS3 bucket. 

Ex. 'USC00069388" gives us the data for WINDHAM CT please give it a try!

Note this is unfinsihed and still needs graph implemtation!

Also note this is the all in the main file. Good progaming it would not be this packed with data.
